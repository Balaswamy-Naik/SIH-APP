         You’re not alone in going through this—many people, especially students, often feel isolated because of stress, studies, or lack of emotional support.
         A few gentle steps you can try right now: Having a set time for meals, sleep, or a walk can help.Do something soothing for yourself: listen to calming music, try deep breathing, or write down your thoughts—sometimes getting them out helps ease the weight.Connect with community: even if face-to-face feels hard, try joining an online group, study circle, or hobby community.'''
